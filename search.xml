        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome guys! My name is Jie and I am super surprised (but delighted) that you happened to come across this post! I am a PhD student in the CDT NLP program, primarily working on speech recognition systems. Here is the <a href="https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">programme page</a>  (People here are extremely friendly), if you are really interested. Before coming here, I worked for about nine months at iFlytek Ltd., a Chinese information technology company with special focus on AI related fields (People are nice there too!).  </p><p>The main reason I set up this blog is to practice my writing, not only to practice my grammar and cultivate my writing style, but also to learn how to explain technical stuff in an interesting way. I will try to include different topics here: new knowledge learned from my uni courses, programming experience I developed while carrying out projects, delightful news related to my research progress (hopefully), interesting things I want to share or maybe just some random, nonsensical gibberish…</p><p>Hope my blogging journey won’t be too short and the next post is coming out soon! Thanks again for reading!</p>]]></content>
